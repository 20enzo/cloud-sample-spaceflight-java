# Serialization of OData V2 request payloads

The V2 JSON serializer converts provided OData Version 2 data into a JSON
string, using OData Version 4 metadata to parse and validate the data. It
can serialize entities, complex properties, and primitive properties. The
required data structures are the same as for the V4 JSON serializer.

The V2 serializer assumes that V2 `Edm.DateTime` properties are mapped to
V4 `Edm.DateTimeOffset` properties and that V2 `Edm.Time` properties are
mapped to V4 `Edm.TimeOfDay` properties.

Every property and its value is validated against the entity-data model
(EDM). Property facets are also validated. If any of these validations fails
a serialization error is thrown.

Metadata properties are not supported.

Deep-insert requests are supported: Navigation properties with associated
data in the input data structure are expanded accordingly.

If meta-properties `<navigationProperty>*@odata.bind` are present,
they are serialized to the V2 equivalents of bind operations, i.e.,
deferred navigation property values. On the same navigation property,
deep insert and bind operation are mutually exclusive.

The V2 raw value of a primitive property can be serialized with the V4
serializer for raw property values because the format is exactly the same
as in V4.
