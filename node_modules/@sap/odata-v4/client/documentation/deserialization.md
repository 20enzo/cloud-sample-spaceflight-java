# Deserialization of OData V2 request payloads

The V2 JSON payload deserializer converts a provided OData Version 2 payload
into a JavaScript object, using OData Version 4 metadata to parse and
validate the data. It can deserialize entities, entity collections, complex
properties, and primitive properties. The resulting data structures are the
same as for the V4 JSON deserializer.

The V2 deserializer assumes that V2 `Edm.DateTime` properties are mapped to
V4 `Edm.DateTimeOffset` properties and that V2 `Edm.Time` properties are
mapped to V4 `Edm.TimeOfDay` properties.

Every property and its value is validated against the entity-data model
(EDM). Property facets are also validated. If any of these validations fails
a deserialization error is thrown.

Inline-count and next-link properties as well as metadata properties are
converted to their V4 meta-property counterparts.

The V2 raw value of a primitive property, obtained with `$value` added to a
property path, can be deserialized with the V4 deserializer for raw property
values because the format is exactly the same as in V4.
